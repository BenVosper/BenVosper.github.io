    may well be their most iconic design. I always thought it seemed elegant,
    and less obnoxiously scary and "tactical" looking than some of their other
    stuff (despite the name...). So when I saw the sought-after
    <a
      href="https://www.spyderco.com/catalog/details/C81MCW2/Para-Military-trade-2-CPM-CRU-WEAR-Micarta/2077"
      >CPM Cru-Wear version</a
    >* actually in stock, I knew I had to pick it up!
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    *Cru-Wear is an insane powder-metallurgy steel, with sprinkings of all the
    spiciest additives you love to see in a sharp pointy thing.
    <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/">Knife Steel Nerds</a> is an
    interesting resource for all the info on the crazy world of steels,
    metallurgy and performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love the design and the performance, but the unfortunate downside of this
    version is the sand-coloured micarta scales. I've got nothing against
    micarta usually but for whatever reason, these ones just happened to turn
    completely dirty and gross after only a little light use. The micarta is
    very matte, so seemed to attract grey and oily fingerprints easily. I had
    hoped it would age in and look amazing like an old cowboy's dusty Levis or
    whatever. But alas, it just looked like I had a dirty knife.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, the design is great and the whole thing is easy to take apart
    and remove the scales. I tried cleaning them: no bueno. So then I tried
    dyeing them bright orange. Which worked but then it was just dirty orange
    instead!
  </p>

  <p>
    For the <i>normal</i> Para 2, there are a whole load of aftermarket scales
    available (see Flytanium etc.). But this Cru-Wear version uses "full"
    liners**, so the off-the-shelf replacements don't fit. So naturally my next
    thought was to completely engineer a new set of scales out of the
    objectively best material ever invented: brass.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    **For additional strength with the micarta apparently.

    The full liners actually make custom scales much easier to manufacture
    though! Since you just make your scale follow the outline of each liner: no
    need to cut a pocket in your material to accommodate the smaller inset
    liners. So all I had to do was cut the shapes out and add the other features
    with enough precision to fit with the threads etc. on the liners.

  <p>
    I'd be interested to know the "proper way" to transfer the position of a
    hole on a thin piece of material onto another (I know about transfer
    punches, but I think the liner is too thin to use them here?). I ended up
    just very carefully scribing the holes onto the brass and bisecting them
    with a pair of calipers. It ended up being accurate enough, but didn't feel
    particularly precise. I feel like there must just be some kind of tool or
    geometric technique for doing it!

    This was me making sure I could actually make everything line up before I
    spend days cutting the shape out. I was pleased! The production scales
    actually have holes for all four possible orientations of the pocket clip. I
    just chose the one position I tend to prefer for cleanliness. Countersinks
    aren't deep enough here. I crept up on them.

    Shaping also went well. Just lots of filing and sanding. Honestly I was
    expecting to have to do a second set, but everything fit well enough for me!

    Then I had a brain aneurysm and thought I should risk days of work and add
    some texture for aesthetics and handling. I saw the nice cutouts on the
    liners and thought it would be easy to engrave some kind of texture! Tried a
    couple of test pieces and settled on this effect using a big rounded punch.
    I like how it turned out, but I think if I did it again I'd just do a more
    aggressive texture all over rather than trying to follow the lines. The
    above shot is after a few days in the good-old
    <a href="/projects/tumbler.html">tumbler</a>. Never fails.

    The hardest bit to do was the slight pocket for the compression lock on the
    left-hand scale. There's ~1.25mm relief in a small section to allow the
    springy bit of the lock to sit in when the blade is closed. You can just
    about see it at the top of the above shot. Ideally you'd just mill it out,
    but I just did it slowly with some Dremel burrs and files. Accuracy isn't
    critical, and you can only see the very top of it when it's assembled.

    Overall I think it looks amazing. It's now just a hair over 200g so almost
    double the stock version, but I like it! I even drilled some material out of
    the inside of the scales to save some weight, but it only took off about
    15g. The tumbling gave it all a very pleasing and organic finish, and the
    brass makes the lockup feel even crisper and more positive. I'm looking
    forwards to seeing how it looks after a few years of having my moist and
    acidic loving hands all over it for a year or two.
