    I've restored a fair quantity of different tools by now, but the majority
    just aren't particularly interesting or beautiful. Also, most projects I
    just don't record very well! So this one's just going to be a mix and match
    of some of my favourites.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the top of the page are a couple of bog-standard engineer's hammers,
    pictured because these got the first set of handles that I made from
    scratch. They feel excellent and I think they came out fantastically as a
    matched pair. Started with some 40x40mm ash and just kinda winged it: first
    planing them down to the flat octagonal profile, then refining the curve
    with a very fine spokeshave (another restoration). I believe the heads were
    just part of an ebay lot, nothing special. They didn't need much, just a
    refresh on the faces and a touch-up. The finish is a cold blue which I find
    works ideally for these small parts which you can completely submerge. These
    two went straight in the "nice" toolbox.

    This is a Record No. 110 which I thought came out nicely. You mostly see
    them in glossy enamel blue, but this black is what I had. I usually find
    painting stuff very hit and miss, but whatever I did here really worked
    well! Also cuts beautifully. I think it was only ever very lightly used.

    Too many axes to choose from, but I picked this one because my friend relies
    on it to head the haunted Victorian schoolhouse she lives in. Without me she
    would have died many moons ago after slowly losing all of her indices to
    frostbite. It's also notable for being the largest example I've ever
    restored, and also the one I've taken to the finest polish (go figure). Here
    you can see a particularly kinky example of my standard cover design for
    which I experimented with natural black dyes. This one was done with a
    vinegar-based mixture known as "vinegaroon". Stinks like hell for an
    annoyingly long time but does give a super rich black which I like. I've
    subsequently changed to using a more robust closing mechanism: these
    pop-studs are quick but aren't particularly strong. I've used these
    Smedbergs handles in a range of sizes and highly recommend.

    I like this one because the head was a random find and a bit of a wildcard.
    I still don't really know what it was specifically for or what kind of
    handle it would have had, so I just went with something I had. I think it
    works! Takes an incredible edge and the little swell under the head is
    excellent for precision work with a nice high grip. I find myself reaching
    for it a lot. The pop-studs
    <strong>do</strong> make sense here with the smaller overall size.

    Last axe, I promise. But this one's a cool one! This was the last, ugliest
    thing left from a big ebay lot which was staring at me from across the room
    for months before I felt guilty enough to do something with it. It was
    pretty heavily pitted, and the profile was just horrendous. So I thought I'd
    try my most ambitious overhaul yet and completely hack it to pieces. Above
    you can see the rough shape I was going for: a kind of "Elwell" style that
    always seem to be ludicrously expensive whenever I see them.

    So hack away I did. Fortunately I think I pulled it off! I was very happy
    with how the old surface blended into the new, and took special care to keep
    the edge cool to not ruin the temper.

    Finished this one with another Smedbergs and a different cover style I was
    trying out. It's more of a faff to construct than the other style, but I
    think on balance it's the better design. Well fitted, there's no way it can
    come off. Overall very pleased with this one. Was proud to give it away as a
    Christmas present.

  <p>
    I built up this set of chisels over some time, a useful range of 3/4, 1/2
    and 1/4 inch in both bevel-edge and flat. They're of mixed pedigree, but fit
    together in an eclectic sort of way I think. They were all re-ground, lapped
    and sharpened. The pouch itself was another escapade. It functions well but
    isn't the most refined design, still trying to think of a better one which
    would fit a range of sizes.

    This is an unremarkable Record pipe wrench, but I had a good time working on
    it! The paint job is just ok, but I think the black hardware really shines
    (cold blue again). Was quite pleased with my custom slim nut and bolt. It
    originally had a press-fit pin holding it all together, which was lame.
