    This design started off as a present for Nana's 80th birthday. Then Mum did
    the classic "I want one of those too", so my contemporary jeweley line now
    extends to two total pieces. It's a brooch made from brass and copper
    tubing. All the copper is recycled from the occasional lucky street find.
    But people don't tend to use solid brass for plumbing so that is
    unfortunately prime virgin tube.

    I had the idea for the construction one afternoon and put together a
    collection of round sections to play with. This symmetric design was the one
    I went with for V1. Everything was cut with one of those screw-in pipe
    cutter things. I don't think it would work as well if you only had a
    hacksaw.

    This is Mum's asymmetrical version which she specifically requested. Here
    you can see the construction process: the bits are arranged on a piece of
    silicone sheet and then I hot-glue around the outer perimeter to seal it
    completely. Then I mix some GFlex epoxy with black pigment and carefully
    pour it into all the voids. Not pictured are the tiny little notches I make
    on the bottom of each round bit so the whole epoxy pour is one big piece.
    When dry, the whole thing pops off the silicone without issue. Some
    isopropanol takes off the hot glue and doesn't touch the epoxy. No drama.
    Also not pictured is the little brooch pin I epoxy to the back.

  <p class="caption">Presentation!</p>

  <p>
    Nana's one got a special presentation plaque (June Something Something
    Morris) and a cute little box that a knife came in. I feel completely
    vindicated in hoarding all the nice boxes in my little secret avalanche
    cupboard when I have to give someone something like this. I need to get a
    picture of them now, because they've both developed the most delightful
    patina after a few months of being mildly handled. Not gross green patina
    like a 2p stuck in the washing machine filter, a really warm reddish shine.
    Need to work out how to replicate.
