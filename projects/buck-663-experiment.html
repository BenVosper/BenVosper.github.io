      >Model 663 - "Alpha Guide"</a

    is a relatively new design from Buck which I decided to shamelessly copy for
    a quick weekend project. I expect the
    <i>International Knife Police™</i> will be breaking down my door any minute
    now for flagrant intellectual property theft. But in my defense, they want
    £240 for their version!! It's not a terrible spec, just seems pricey to me.
    Maybe it's more reasonable in dollars.

    My version removes the (ugly and questionably useful) jimping in favour of a
    more refined "MKM-style" crowned spine and handle. I was actually amazed at
    my efficiency when I managed to do the designs, cut the blade profile, drill
    the scale holes and lightening holes, file the lanyard hole, round over the
    spine etc. <b>and</b> cut the bevels all in one day! Still no belt grinder,
    so the good old
    <a href="/projects/tanto.html#file-on-a-stick-pic"
      >file on a stick method</a

    again here. I'm getting quicker at setting everything up.

    Used some fire brick sealant to attempt a differential hardening (hard edge,
    soft spine for durability). See
    <a href="the-hot-log.html">The Hot Log</a> warming up in the background
    here. The clay definitely worked! The edge was over 60HRC (very
    approximately) according to my test files while the spine was nice and soft.
    It also produced a very distinct pattern when etching the blade in ferric
    chloride later, but it wasn't as visible as I've had with 1095 in the past.

    I also specifically picked this design with some nice simple scales was so
    that I could play with this bit of Kirinite I impulse-purchased a while
    back. I thought the scale contours would show off the material nicely. I
    haven't used a lot of plastics really, so was just testing it out. It was
    actually very pleasant to work with: cuts and sands easily. Makes a big old
    mess though and I probably sucked in about 10KG of microplastics. Oh well.

    It's hard to photograph, but the little finger-divots at the front of the
    scales came out really well. I ground them out with a rounded carbide burr
    on a dremel. Surprisingly leaves a very smooth finish on the acrylic which
    then sands out nicely.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't really know the proper process to polish this stuff up. Most places
    seem to use a very fast buffing wheel, which I don't have. But wet sanding
    with some very fine silicon carbide paper seemed to work well, with a final
    hand polish with some plastic polish to make it shine. Grip is ok, it's not
    mirror-slick. But I don't think this stuff is intended to be the whole
    handle really... Looks nice though!
  </p>

  <p>
    No epoxy under these scales, they're fully removable with some M4 bolts and
    some custom sleeve nuts which align everything. I've found it to be a nice
    reliable system, and greatly prefer it over the pressure of just gluing
    everything together. Much better for future maintenance too.
  </p>

  <p>
    The blade was hand sanded to 800 grit, acid etched in ferric chloride and
    then lightly tumbled in some ceramic media. I find this leaves a very
    pleasing matte finish which is much more practical than a mirror polish. I
    also have a theory that the etched surface is better at retaining a thin
    layer of oil which will help with corrosion resistance in the long-term.
    Would be interesting to test one day.

  <p>
    The scales and sheath were completed in the second weekend. Not bad four
    four relaxing days I think!
  </p>

  <p>
    This is my first "taco" style kydex sheath. It's ok. I think I could have
    had the tip slightly closer to the top edge of the sheath, which would make
    the end nicer. But the retention is excellent, and the thumb ramp is very
    satisfying, having been moulded directly to my personal thumb.
  </p>

  <p>
    Put a very pretty edge on it with my TSProf (around 20° per side), and it's
    an absolute laser beam. More thorough edge-retention testing needed, but
    there's now no longer any cardboard left in my place and it's still going
    strong!
