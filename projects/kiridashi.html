    Everyone got a handmade present on Christmas 2020. I hope they liked them,
    because that was all they got. Felt slightly bad on Christmas morning
    receiving multiple presents from everyone waiting for the opportune moment
    to hand out one tiny box each. But hey-ho. Quantity over quality and all
    that.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've had a very cheap kiridashi on my desk for years now. It's easy to
    sharpen and serves as a great general-purpose poker / scraper / slicer etc.
    They're often very simple in construction, which I appreciate. These were a
    refinement on the basic design concept. You often see kiridashi with a
    chisel grind: flat on one side with one bevel tapering the whole way. But
    these have a normal flat grind because that's what my example happened to
    have. I don't think there's much difference in practicality. I can see the
    chisel grind being more useful for a woodworking / marking knife.

    I didn't make a prototype of these, which is why each one is slightly
    different. I was working most of it out as I went along. If I did another
    three they'd all be much better! The bevels were cut by hand with a filing
    jig which I've used relatively successfully on a number of pieces now. I
    should probably put together a more permanent setup for that for a bit more
    consistency.

    Hardening is nice and simple with these (in my normal 1095) because they're
    so small. The old blowtorch and coffee-can forge works a treat.

    Three shades of woody. You can also see the evolution of my bevel filing
    technique here. I think the one at the front where the bevel is shorter and
    flows more smoothly into the body is better.

    Handle scales were random picks from the hardwood pile. Usually kiridashi
    don't have handles like this, most just have the raw hammered surface of the
    steel. But these do help to center your grip quite nicely: your index finger
    and thumb naturally sit on the spine where the handle ends.

    These got special presentation coffins just because they were presents. The
    20mm cork was relatively inexpensive and easy to shape. Cheap B&Q pine looks
    a lot better when you set fire to it. Or at least looks less like cheap B&Q
    pine? The little medallions are stupid, but I did them to match the brass
    knob (also with BV20) that went on Mum's <a href="satchel.html">handbag</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My biggest struggle with these was that I'm still incapable of cutting wood
    with any precision at all. Even these nice rectangles were all mismatched in
    all dimensions. I just need to spend more time planing / measuring. It's
    currently a bit of a vicious cycle where I can never get it right, so I'm
    not enjoying practicing so I just say "good enough". But if I could be more
    consistent all the subsequent processes would be so much easier!
  </p>

  <p>
    Anywho. It's nearly May now, so I should probably get started on this year's
    presents...
