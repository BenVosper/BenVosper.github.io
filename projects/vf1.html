  <p>
    My first folding knife design. Designed from scratch and built entirely by
    hand, featuring:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      3mm thick, full flat ground blade using the sublime
      <a href="https://www.erasteel.com/products/asp-2053/">ASP-2053</a> steel
      at 64HRC
    </li>
    <li>Sandblasted Grade 5 Titanium frame</li>
    <li>Frame lock with ceramic bearing lockbar insert</li>
    <li>Bronze washers</li>
    <li>Stainless torx screws and pivot</li>
    <li>One-hand opening and closing</li>
    <li>Extremely solid lockup, no lock-stick, perfect centering</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I'm not claiming that this is the best or most beautiful design ever, nor
    that it's particularly original. I've taken inspiration and design ideas
    from a load of similar knives by great designers. I mostly just wanted to
    see if I could pull off my own version.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've always appreciated the elegance of
    <a href="https://chrisreeve.com/">Chris Reeve's</a> legendary "Reeve
    Integral Lock" design. Now widely copied, you often hear them referred to as
    "frame locks" because the primary element stopping the blade from closing is
    a flexible portion of the knife's frame itself. A very efficient design with
    a minimum of moving parts, with the strength and satisfying feeling of the
    lockup being absolutely unparalleled when implemented properly. So when I
    started thinking about my own folder design, I pretty much immediately went
    with the framelock concept.

  <p class="caption">Considering hand modelling...</p>

  <p>
    I quickly realised that the design and manufacturing considerations are many
    times more complex with folders than with nice simple fixed-blades. You have
    a whole world of inter-related variables around the opening and closing
    mechanism that impact performance and handling, that you somehow have to
    balance and compromise with the aesthetics and ergonomics of the various
    parts. I spent many late nights in the CAD black-hole, moving splines back
    and forwards before I finally landed on a design that would theoretically
    work, I theoretically liked the look of, and I could theoretically
    manufacture in my small garage.

  </div>

  <p class="caption">
    Looking at this first one, it's a miracle I managed to pull this off
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where my series of side-quests began. My early prototypes were
    really suffering from lack of precision: a mounting hole being 0.5mm out of
    position on a fixed blade is basically unnoticeable, and can be reasonably
    accommodated by adjusting the scales or handle holes to match. But a similar
    inaccuracy here essentially renders the whole part scrapped. Or at the very
    best requiring an individual hand-fudging to multiple parts which might mean
    you can actually assemble the thing, but it now doesn't match the plans and
    your carefully designed clearances and mechanism no longer work.
  </p>

  <p>
    So side-quest sub-project 1 was to devise a better method of laying out my
    paper plans onto the physical materials. I've tried a load of different
    solutions this year, having become frustrated with the old-faithful "glue
    the printer paper to the metal" technique on the
    <a href="./vk1-ft.html">kitchen knife</a>. With the paper wearing or burning
    off or getting sodden with oil, it's impossible to actually hit your lines.
    But I eventually stumbled upon quite a reliable method of transferring the
    actual printed toner to the metal via the application of acetone under mild
    heating:
  </p>

        alt="an image of a piece of metal with lines on it"
      />
    </label>
  </div>

  <p class="caption">Toner-transfer used for marking out.</p>

  <p>
    This leaves you with an incredibly sharp and durable line which resists
    heating while grinding. Holes can also be center-punched to within 0.1 -
    0.2mm of spec (I'm guessing here) with an optical center-punch. Which turns
    out to be good enough for the whole thing to go together. I still have room
    for improvement here, which I hope will come with practice. It turns out
    that this technique is known as "toner transfer" and can be used for
    <a
      href="https://hackaday.com/2016/09/12/take-your-pcbs-from-good-to-great-toner-transfer/"
      >PCB manufacturing</a
    >
    which needs to achieve even greater resolution and coverage accuracy than I
    need for marking out! Room to improve my process here too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other than drill-hole placement, I also had the need to accurately
    <b>depth</b> holes. Both the opening and closing detents and aesthetics of
    the external screws all rely on accurate and consistent depths, which I had
    never really needed before. Which brings us to side-quest number 2:
    upgrading the drill-press!
  </p>

      />
    </label>
  </div>

  <p class="caption">Thrilling drilling</p>

  <p>
    Here you can see I managed to fashion a DRO (digital readout) from a cheap
    pair of calipers, and added a worklight to illuminate the target spot, both
    powered with a DC supply mounted inside the housing and sharing the drill's
    AC input. So no coin-cells to run out! You can just about see the separate
    switch nicely mounted underneath the motor power in the photo above. I also
    overcame my commitment issues and screwed the whole thing down to the
    worktop to minimise jiggling. All of these combined means that I can
    theoretically accurately hit the spot I just centerpunched and drill to a
    consistent known depth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Which brings us to the third and final side-quest: that big beautiful slot!
  </p>

  <div class="click-zoom">

      <img
        loading="lazy"
        src="../assets/vf1/slot.jpg"
        alt="an image of a knife with a nice tight slot"
      />
    </label>
  </div>

  <p class="caption">0.5mm slot forming the framelock spring</p>

  <p>
    This slot is what allows the spring portion of the frame to move inwards and
    apply the locking force to the blade. I really wanted to keep this as small
    and elegant as possible, and avoid any clearance holes at the end and
    corners of the slot. I suppose these holes simplify manufacturing, but I
    find them a little bit ugly. See the
    <a href="https://spyderco.com/products/spydiechef%E2%84%A2">SpydieChef™</a>
    (which I love) for an example of a very generous wide slot and clearance
    holes. I wanted to shoot for something a little tighter and cleaner.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some early success with 0.5mm HSS slitting saws in the drill-press (see
    third prototype on the green cutting mat photo above) gave me confidence
    that this thin little slot was actually doable. I just had to devise a
    process which was reliable and safer than <i>manually</i> moving the vise
    and frame under the spinning blade (which I'm <b>NOT</b> going to show).
    Enter the compound vise!
  </p>

  <div class="click-zoom">

        alt="an image of a restored XY table"
      />
    </label>
  </div>

  <p class="caption">Restored XY compound vise</p>

  <p>
    This was the smallest compound vise I'd ever come across, with only a 75mm
    jaw-width. Picked it up on eBay very reasonably because it had some parts
    missing. Two new hardened jaws and a handle later (guess which one is
    mine...) and I could accurately cut the bulk of the slot without breaking
    saws or raising my blood-pressure to previously unknown levels. You can't
    cut the whole thing all the way through because you can't get the blade
    right on the center-line of the saw because the arbor is in the way. But it
    was easy enough to connect the two slots using a modified wide hacksaw blade
    once the slitting saw has cut a nice guide line most of the way through.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final knife in the pretty photos above is the 6th major design revision
    and the product of 3 completed prototypes and 5 or 6 sets of frames which
    didn't make it that far! It was always such a relief to get past cutting the
    slot knowing that the hard parts were (mostly) done. I took a few rounds of
    iteration to come up with the style of chamfer and type of finish I liked on
    the frame scales:

    </label>
  </div>

  <p class="caption">Early prototype sandblasted frames</p>

  <p>
    Sandblasted titanium looks and feels excellent. Fresh out of blasting it's
    very bright white and almost sparkles with all the different micro-facets.
    But with a little handling and a light oil, you get the nice titanium grey
    and lovely smooth but grippy handfeel. I haven't yet experimented with
    anodising on top of this sandblast. Ideas ideas...

    </label>
  </div>

  <p class="caption">Clippy!</p>

  <p>
    The clip also needed a few design revisions. I eventually landed on this
    relatively thin design in the same sandblasted finish as the frames. The
    polished titanium and brass variants were interesting but a bit
    <i>too</i> audacious for me...
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a hidden pin below the clip screw so the whole thing can't spin
    around. Adds a very reassuring interference fit, but needed to be absolutely
    <b>perfectly</b> accurate to work!

  <p class="caption">Memories of hand sanding...</p>

  <p>
    I thought I'd make things extra difficult for myself on this first
    successful one and do a high-polish on the blade. Remember that this
    ASP-2053 is specifically designed to be highly abrasive and wear resistant!
    Definitely took me a fair few hours, and gave me knifemaker's elbow. It's
    not a full mirror polish, but it's good enough for me. I'll be interested to
    see how the ASP holds up (I usually stonewash for the nice dark finish). It
    really goes well with the stainless hardware.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe I should try one with one carbon-fibre left frame and a dark
    stonewashed blade and hardware...

  <p class="caption">
    This gives you an idea of how the framelock works. Ignore my wobbly chamfer
    lines - at least you can tell it's handmade.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here we can see the inside of the knife in the open position. The lock bar
    springs downwards and the ball bearing rides against a precisely-angled part
    of the blade. The bearing is interference fit into the titanium frame and
    protrudes into the front slot. As you can imagine, the precise positioning
    of the bearing relative to the back of the blade, the angle of the angled
    portion, the spring tension of the lockbar, and polish and roundovers on the
    blade part all play a huge part in the handfeel of using the mechanism. It
    took a lot of revisions to get right. It's a lot of work, but I'm really
    happy with this one.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a similar number of variables on the closing detent. There's a blind
    hole on the pivot portion of the blade which the ball bearing rests in,
    which gives a satisfying click when it lands closed (at the same point the
    back of the blade comes to rest on the brass stop-pin), and also lets the
    lockbar sit flush with the rest of the frame. The size of this blind hole as
    well as the spring tension determine the blade's resistance to opening.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't invent this ball-bearing concept obviously, it's all copied from
    the Chris Reeve Inkosi (hey, if it ain't broke...). But I had to figure out
    all the geometry for my design. And fitting the ball directly into the frame
    definitely has manufacturing and design advantages compared to a more
    complicated lockbar insert or just going raw frame-on-blade.

  <p>
    Here you can see the brass backspacer and stop-pin. I like the little pop of
    colour.
  </p>

  <p>
    After I finished all the photos, I had some fun using the blade finally!
    Very very happy with the performance. The polish definitely adds a certain
    smoothness, and the steel is incredible as ever.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I finally finished this piece which I'm about 95% happy with, I was
    very relieved to take a break from the folder project for a while! But now
    I'm almost through the recovery period, I'm sure it won't be long before the
    next revision...
