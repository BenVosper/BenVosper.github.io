    This was a prototype that turned out so ROCK SOLIDâ„¢ that it's become one of
    my most-used devices and hasn't missed a beat.

    It's just a jar which you fill with some kind of media and your parts. It
    then rotates at a speed you set in order to gently grind / polish whatever
    you put inside it. I use it a lot for small parts (eg. knife bolsters) and
    disassembled tools, the only limit is what you can physically fit in the
    jar.

    I just wanted an excuse to play with some casting epoxy...
  </p>

  <p>
    The cylinder itself is constructed from a cheap screw-top plastic food
    container (from the legendary Khan's Bargain, Peckham. They've got
    <em>everything...</em>). I chose this one because of it's hourglass shape
    which I thought might help it self-center itself on the rollers. It turned
    out to actually make it much worse, but two little guides on either end keep
    it in place. Internally, I added some wooden baffles to help with agitating
    the media. Then the whole thing is covered in a hard casting epoxy which is
    slowly worn away and can be topped up with a new pour if needed (I've only
    done this once after two years of use). All seems to work fine. I considered
    glass jars, but I'd be nervous about heavier parts hitting that 1-in-10000
    ultra-bounce and smashing the whole thing...
  </p>

  <p>
    I've mostly used it with specialised ceramic media and water, with a splash
    of detergent (the foam that forms helps to quiet the whole thing down). I
    did buy a bottle of the expensive solution you're supposed to use with the
    media but never found it to be needed. Maybe it prolongs the life of the
    media or something, but it's not like I use it enough to notice.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a very fine matte polish, I've also found a mixture of stainless-steel
    pins, metal polish and WD40 to work surprisingly well. Much messier than the
    water though.
  </p>

  <p>
    I tend to set it up on the sofa to prevent vibrations being transferred into
    the ceiling downstairs (sorry No. 75....). This coupled with an ad-hoc
    isolation booth made of cushions and throws means you can't even hear it in
    the next room. Fine to leave running all day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aside from it's surprising robustness, this monstrosity is only notable
    because it was one of my early forays into PCB design. I happened to have
    the stepper motor to use, so decided to make a control board for it based
    around a jellybean
    <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1182">A4988 driver</a>. These
    drivers just take a PWM signal to tell the motor to step so abstract away
    all the complexity of microstepping etc. In my case the variable-frequency
    PWM signal is provided by a 555 in an astable configuration. Don't laugh at
    the whole buck converter just for the 555, this was before I knew about
    voltage regulators. Obviously a 7805 would be fine in place of that.

    This was my second PCB, after the relative success of the
    <a href="pumpmaster5000.html">Pumpmaster 5000</a>. All done via
    <a href="https://easyeda.com/">EasyEDA</a> because JLCPCB was the service
    I'd seen advertised most. For a complete amateur, it was remarkably easy to
    convert this simple schematic into a board layout and then into a physical
    board! The hardest part was getting all of the footprints for the specific
    boards I had correct. But we got there in the end.

  <p class="caption">All in all, two revisions isn't bad for a first timer!</p>

  <p>
    If I was to do another revision, I'd have dip switches for all of the
    configuration pins on the driver so that you could modify the microstep
    parameters etc. on the fly. And even add another 555 assembly to feed a slow
    PWM signal into the step direction pin! For a kinda back-and-forwards
    washing machine motion which would help even out the wear in the drum
    automatically.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next <em>hardware</em> revision will get a bigger drum, bigger motor,
    actual bearings on the casters, an actual enclosure for the driver and an
    actual knob for the potentiometer.
