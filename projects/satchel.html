    <a href="../assets/satchel/finished.jpg">This</a> was the Mum's piece from
    the BV20 Christmas Series. See the
    <a href="kiridashi.html">Kiridashi</a> project for the others. At some point
    Mum saw some axe covers or something and assumed that I'd of course then be
    able to make complex 3D shapes. She requested a handbag with a bewildering
    handwavey brief which I promptly forgot entirely. So I ended up taking some
    inspiration from a number of similar pieces I could find detailed images of
    online and working it out from there. I probably could have bought a
    pattern, but I enjoy the constant stress of potentially ruining loads of
    nice material.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another piece I didn't make a prototype for! Just muddled my way through. I
    think this came out well though. I've always found leather surprisingly
    forgiving to work with. After you get it all joined together, it tends to
    look pretty ok after you fondle it around a bit.

    I did make a template though. I estimated how thick the seams would need to
    be and how the curves would all line up. Seemed to work out well enough
    because all of the stitching was surprisingly painless. And quite neat I
    think!

    I'm sure there's probably some theory involved in planning stitch spacing
    for going around these corners, but I don't know it. Because of the way
    everything folds up, the outer edges of the pieces end up stretching as you
    stitch them. But I tried not to overthink it and just stuck with the
    constant spacing all the way around. Then when the pieces were glued
    together, it was easy enough to wiggle an awl through one side to find the
    hole on the other. And I didn't have any holes left over or anything, so it
    must have been fine. Not sure I'd like to do anything more complicated than
    this though!
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a little pocket on the inside for a credit card or a maoam. Other
    than that it's a single big cuboid for your possessions to clonk around in.
    It's got a single magnetic clasp in the center which felt sufficently grippy
    to me. I considered buckles but thought they'd be too impractical. The BV20
    knob covers up the other side of the clasp and matches the medallions on the
    <a href="kiridashi.html">Kiridashi</a> presentation boxes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I ended up making the strap humorously long by fitting the holes perfectly
    for myself instead of for a normal sized old lady. But some aftermarket
    modifications have since fixed that issue. I also forgot to put the strap
    keeper on before the buckle.
  </p>

  <p>
    I usually enjoy working on things that don't have to be quite so exacting in
    their appearance: function over form is my preferred tradeoff. But this
    wasn't too bad. Mum was happy, anyway.

  <h3>2021 Updates</h3>

  <p>By popular demand, the satchels returned for Christmas 2021.</p>

    This second revision features a couple of improvements over the first. And
    not just because I lost the pattern and had to make it from scratch again.
    The brass knob on the front is now positively affixed by a threaded rod into
    which the top half of the magnetic closure screws from the other side, the
    straps are the right length and the keepers are correct this time.
