  <p>
    I've been wanting to make some more kitchen knives ever since my first
    <a href="/projects/petty-2020.html">fooling around</a> a few years ago.
    Since then I've learned a lot, and have finally got a proper grinder etc. to
    make it actually viable. So I put together this design which is relatively
    simple but has a couple of unique touches for some flair, and combines a few
    techniques I'd been working on for a while. We've got:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Blade using high-performance
      <a href="https://www.erasteel.com/products/asp-2053/">ASP-2053</a> steel
    </li>
    <li>Sandblasted aluminium handles with a Cerakote coating</li>
    <li>A tapered tang to help with weight distribution</li>
    <li>Dramatic finger-cutout for aesthetics and a good forward grip</li>
    <li>Cool inset stainless screws</li>
    <li>An electro-etched makers mark</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The steel is absolutely insane, and really does perform well. Hard to
    compare apples to apples, but it holds that sticky sharp edge for longer
    than anything else I've got in the kitchen (including modern SG2), and
    responds really well to stropping. It's not stainless, but doesn't get that
    gross orange rust you get if you abuse carbon steel blades. Instead it takes
    on a lovely dark grey patina with use, which I bring out from the beginning
    with an acid etch and stonewash. I find it very pretty, and much less fussy
    than a fancy mirror-polished stainless knife: it feels like a tool. I <3
    high-alloy tool steels.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yes, <a href="/projects/the-hot-log.html">The Hot Log</a> does get up to
    1150°C and hold accurately for 15 minutes. I <3 hot log.

    Here I was experimenting with printing out the profile on acetate to draw
    around, rather than gluing a paper cutout to the steel. It worked ok. I
    still haven't found a way of marking out I like...
  </p>

  <p>
    I went through a few design revisions here. Originally I had a stick-tang
    design with a pin and matching spacer between the two handle scales. It
    would have been ok, and used less steel. But I was never really happy with
    the looks, and I HATED the actual process of gluing everything up with epoxy
    (I made at least 4 of them trying to get it perfect). So I moved on to this
    full-tang design where the handle can flow right into the blade (chef's
    kiss), and I can use hardware to attach the scales, which gives me lots more
    options for different looks and finishes.
  </p>

    I've now become allergic to making a full-tang without a taper...
  </p>

  <p>
    Here you can see the tapered tang, with the scales tapered to match.
    Theoretically it removes as much mass from the back of the handle to keep
    the balance forwards, but I haven't worked out how much of a difference it
    makes. Mostly it's just because it's cool.
  </p>

  <p>
    By some combination of luck and judgement, the balance of the final piece is
    absolutely perfect. Totally balanced on your front fingers when you're
    nestled into the little cutout. I could probably fine-tune it a little more
    by hollowing out the scales or even skeletonising the tang, but I'm more
    than happy as it is.

  <p>
    You quickly come to realise that kitchen knives are in another league of
    difficulty than the kinda nice easy thick general purpose knives I've made
    before. You have to go thin for good slicing performance, and you need a
    good amount of length. Which just means you've got a whole load more edge to
    manage, and big flat sides to make look perfect, AND it's all super thin so
    is just dying to overheat and ruin your day. I did a few in 1095 before
    eventually moving to the ASP-2053 to make it even more difficult for myself.
    I was actually pleasantly surprised though, I was expecting the high
    wear-resistant steel to put up significantly more of a fight than my usual
    carbon steel, but it was only slightly slower. It's actually potentially
    slightly more forgiving in grinding since you don't lose all your hardness
    as soon as you go over 200°C with a little burn mark like you do with 1095.
    I still went very slow and kept everything cold though.
  </p>

  <p>
    The photo above is when I've finally finished the blade profiling and can
    move on to the scales and finishing. Getting here always felt like a
    victory: plenty of blades didn't make it this far while I dialed in my
    process!

  <p class="caption">This is ugly I know, it was just an experiment</p>

  <p>
    I was also experimenting with a few different looks and finishes with my
    prototypes. This one is a Cerakote blade, which makes a lot of sense on 1095
    in the kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised with the durability, but I think
    it's better suited for scales and handles than for blades themselves. This
    is also some different hardware which doesn't work quite as well as the
    final ones I went for: a little too industrial.

    Prepare for every metal object I own to have my initials on it soon...
  </p>

  <p>
    Because you have to do so much grinding after hardening on these, I couldn't
    just bang in a set of initials with my normal punches like I'd usually do.
    So I eventually sorted out ordering a set of tiny stencils and got a simple
    electro-etching process working pretty well! I was really pleased with how
    these came out. You get some really beautifully crisp lines, even with tiny
    3mm tall letters, and great depth with a very controllable process.
    Definitely going to be doing more of these! Sourcing stencils is the only
    slightly annoying part. I used the single-use sticky vinyl stencils, but
    I've seen people use multi-use ones too. But I'm not sure if those put
    constraints on your stencil design: I've got disconnected sections here
    which I like.
