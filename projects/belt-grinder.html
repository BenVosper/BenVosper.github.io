  <p>
    One fateful morning I noticed that someone had left a washing machine next
    to the bins in my garden. RESULT.
  </p>

    I've been a long-time fan of

    of videos detailing how washing machine parts, and specifically motors can
    be repurposed. So I'd had my eye out for one to play with for a while!
  </p>

  <p>
    Side note, this guy is one of my favourite creators and all of his stuff is
    gold: extremely informative and entertaining. I admire his philosophy. Very
    few people would take the time to not only repair old tools and equipment,
    but also document the process in order to educate others and demystify
    electromechanical devices. I only wish there were such amazing scrapyards in
    the UK!*
  </p>

    *If there are, I can't find them. Maybe you have to know a guy...
  </p>

    So out I pop, spanners in hand. I wave to the lady at Number 85 and proceed
    to extract this lump of a motor from the washing machine like an oily pearl.
    It's dusty, but otherwise pristine. There's really not a lot going on in
    these big motors, so it's more often than not the electronics or some other
    more fragile component that's caused the whole washing machine to be thrown
    away. Sad for the planet, but at least recycling a part of it is something?

    Beauty. (Don't worry, those are fully sterilised workshop-pants)
  </p>

  <p>
    I left it inside to dry out for a couple of days before giving it a test.
    The pinout is easy to work out by measuring the resistances across pairs of
    wires (see the playlist above).
  </p>

  <p>
    It's a universal motor which runs on AC in the machine, but can also work
    with DC to take the danger down from a 10 to like a soft 6. So you use one
    DC supply for the coil and another for the rotor. She spins up beautifully!
    You can play with the voltages you apply to the coil and rotor to get into
    the torque / speed range you need. It's got plenty of grunt for a benchtop
    tool of some kind, so I start thinking! Toyed with a wood lathe (another
    day...) but eventually decided that I'd get more use out of a grinder. The
    nice ridged pulley on the shaft is also convenient for this: one less thing
    I have to faff with.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wish I could say I meticulously planned every aspect of my design before
    making parts one by one, referencing my plans. But that's just not how I
    roll (I have a problem, help me...). I basically just mentally simulate
    various arrangements of parts of the course of many days until I can see the
    whole thing working then dive in. It's less like engineering and more like
    art? Maybe. My final mental design involves a system of sliding rails
    clamped to a fixed platten by some chunky thread. I'm both limited by the
    engineering and construction techniques my amaterish brain knows about as
    well as what I'm physically able to manufacture in my space.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only parts I bought were a few bearings, some 20mm steel rod for the
    roller shafts and a chunky 12V power supply. The main construction was 18mm
    MDF which I had in the pile. The hardest part was the rollers! How do you
    make a nicely concentric cylinder of arbitrary diameter without a lathe? (Or
    3D printer, CNC, band-saw etc. etc. etc.) My first bright idea was to cut a
    series of MDF blanks out using a holesaw and stack them up. Fought with this
    for a while before abandoning the idea: it's impossible to make everything
    concentric with the central bore, especially without a drill press. What I
    eventually landed on was a highly-advanced carbohydrate-polymer composite I
    fabricated by tightly rolling up thick backing paper with superglue. Not a
    joke. That's literally how the rollers were made. They've been pretty solid
    so far! Which is lucky, because they're never coming off those shafts...

    This is the pretty much finished superstucture around which I'm fitting the
    electronics. Motor is a lovely tight fit and nicely square with the
    drive-side shaft. Here the coil is getting 12V directly from the PSU, and
    the rotor is getting supplied by that boost converter whose knob I'm
    twiddling (meter display is this boosted rotor voltage / current). The 12V
    coil voltage was picked to give enough torque with a decent range of speeds.
    The motor could take a LOT more power, but this is sufficient for this
    device made from wood. Added a 120mm fan and some ducting to at least waft
    some air over the thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here you can also see the slots in which those two outer bearing-holders
    ride to allow me to tension the belts. In a manner of speaking.
  </p>

  <p>
    The roller-side pulley (see first photo) <strong>is</strong> a holesaw blank
    with some little walls glued on. I started off with a cheap Flymo belt I
    found which happened to have the right profile (J Section Poly V) but later
    upgraded to a much fatter one for max torque (SimplyBearings has
    everything).

    Well used. Yes, the power supply hangs over the edge. I did measure it but
    forgot to account for the wires poking out of the business-end of the
    supply. Oh well. The fan is in between the supply and the motor, sucking
    fresh air through the duct and out the back. The foam over the supply intake
    is just because I didn't have any mesh. It's fine (probably)
  </p>

  <p>
    All buttoned-up it works fine. Plenty of juice, but its fabricobbled nature
    results in a less than optimal user experience. Tracking is a pain to
    adjust, and it's awkward to have anything run off the sides of the platten
    because the bearing runners overhang. Found myself mostly using the rollers
    themselves for most work. But it played a major role in the construction of
    all the knives I made in late 2020, both on steel and in handle
    construction. It was a fun project, I look forward to making another one day
    when I can weld!
