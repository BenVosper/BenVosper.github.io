    What even is this? I don't know. Maybe a serving tray? Sure, but don't put
    any wine glasses on it because they'll slip through the gaps. In fact, don't
    put anything wet on it or you'll smudge the shellac. I guess just put some
    piece of static ephemera on it, store in a cool, dry place and admire from a
    distance. But it looks ok right? Can't really go wrong with dark American
    walnut and polished brass.

    I actually amazed myself at the straightness and accuracy of this cut. Maybe
    because I was hyper-conscious that I didn't want to ruin this expensive
    plank. It came planed so I didn't have much work to do other than cut it in
    half. Thought about putting a spline or a biscuit in, but it's not
    structural so I didn't bother.

    Absolute dimensions weren't critical here but consistency was, unless I
    wanted a wobbly tray. So spent longer than I'd care to admit getting these
    close enough together with a good old file. Then the chamfer and nice
    circular polish was done on my tiny little lathe! (Proxxon DB250).

    The holes for the little fences were drilled with a Big Gator V-Drill Guide,
    super useful for drilling perfectly radially. The fences just friction fit
    in there nicely.

    I had some bold ambitions of having a bit of thread come out axially from
    the big leg, go through the tray and have the bottom leg screw in so the
    whole thing could be glue-less. But I struggled with keeping everything
    straight and central. You'd really need a lathe and a center drill to do it
    properly. So I just expoxied the hell out of it all and it's solid. The
    posts are recessed into the surface slightly, so it was quite forgiving.

    The finish is homemade golden shellac, which looks good! I think if I took
    the wood to a higher grit (this was just 800 or something) you could do a
    French polish. But would take a lot of time!

    Featuring a secret knob on the bottom. This was Mum's gift for Christmas
    2021. It's still on the coffee table, so I guess she doesn't
    <i>completely</i> hate it? Or maybe she just gets it out when I'm around...
