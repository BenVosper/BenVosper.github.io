    These are a pair of general-purpose knives in the style of a traditional
    Finnish "Puukko". I'm not sure if the leather-stacked handles are
    technically traditional, but I think they work thematically (you sometimes
    see stacked birch-bark used). I like the simplicity of the design, and
    they're a good size for everyday use.

    I made two to try out a couple of different things on each one, but they
    both have the same blade shape. The cross-section is almost like a diamond,
    but with the center line closer to the spine which leaves the spine flat on
    the top for handling. It actually wasn't too tricky to cut using a filing
    jig: you start at the edge and set your primary bevel, then turn it over and
    just bring the back bevel in to meet it. There's no ricasso, so you can just
    carry the bevels over the line where the bolster will sit (see below).

    I was being over-cautious here and left the edge way too thick. I've never
    had an edge crack on me with my current process, so recently I've been fine
    taking things down much closer to final thickness before hardening. But the
    geometry looks good! I was using sandpaper glued to a rigid steel backer to
    keep the lines crisp.

    The first blade was completed before my
    <a href="the-hot-log.html">muffle furnace</a> was ready, so this one was
    hardened using my propane forge. I've got it down to a fine art now, but
    this blade is about as big as you could do reliably with this setup: the
    hotspot in the forge is so small that you have to constantly be moving the
    blade to heat it evenly.

  <p>
    Remember earlier when I said the lack of ricasso makes the blade easy to
    grind? Well now you have to fit the bolster to a
    <strong>five-sided</strong> blade! I didn't appreciate the difficulty of
    this step in my non-existent planning phase, and it took a few tries to
    finally get it right. This successful attempt was done by filing the bolster
    to allow it to fit over most of the tang, undercutting the hole with a
    dremel, then bashing the whole thing down onto the shoulders of the blade.
    The brass deforms perfectly against the contours of the hardened steel and
    seats itself. It also slides on and off very easily, which is nice for
    finishing.

    Here you can see the blade and bolster both finished and the handle being
    fitted. I made the clamping jig to help with compressing the leather, but I
    think it mostly just got in the way. The bottom bolster is also friction-fit
    onto the tang and provides all of the compression needed. Once the glue is
    dry it's just a matter of carving the handle shape. My first effort wasn't
    perfect visually, but it feels great.

    Overall I was very happy with how the first one came out. The secondary
    bevel wouldn't have been so high if I'd thinned the edge down further - but
    let's say I did that on purpose for durability...

    The second knife is largely the same, but I experimented with a stonewashed
    finish instead of the high-polish, textured bronze bolster and black
    leather. Here you can see me not being lazy and actually cutting leather
    ovals instead of just using squares. I cut them using a series of homemade
    punches made from steel tubes. Saved a whole load of time with the handle
    shaping. This one was also hardened and tempered in the
    <a href="the-hot-log.html">muffle furnace</a>.

    Here you can just about make out the hammered top surface of the bronze
    bolster (it looks better in person) which just makes finishing a lot easier
    because you don't have to worry so much about scratching the blade while
    polishing. The difference in blade finish is also visible here. The
    stonewashing was done by dipping the finished blade in ferric chloride then
    shaking it in a bottle of rocks. It's certainly easier than sanding to fine
    grits, but I think I need to experiment with getting the oxide to stay
    darker. Will be interesting to see how they both age with use.

    Not much to say about the sheaths other than I think I got super lucky when
    making the pattern: I love the shape. It all seems like it's too small while
    you're sewing it together, but then you wet everything and slot the finished
    knife in and it all stretches and flows around the handle then hardens up
    and fits like a glove. Very satisfying. I also need to work out how to get
    the handles themselves to shine up nicely: they're all burnished like I
    usually do, but they don't seem to want to stay glossy. Maybe they need
    sanding to a higher grid before finishing? Anyway, I suspect this will also
    happen over time with use.
