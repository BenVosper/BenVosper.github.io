  <p>
    Of <em>course</em> I'm into keyboards. What kind of soft-handed computer boy
    do you take me for?
  </p>

  <p>
    This was my first full custom build assembled from the excellent
    <a href="https://nullbits.co/nibble/">Nullbits "Nibble" 65% kit</a>. Usually
    I like a TKL, but I saw this actually in stock for once and knew I should
    grab it while I had the chance!
  </p>

  <p>
    It's extremely complicated to navigate the ever changing landscape of PCBs,
    switches, lubricants, layouts, keycaps, profiles, controllers, firmwares
    etc. in the world of mechanical keyboards. But that's simply the price you
    pay to get <em>just</em> what you want. In this particular build, I went
    with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://nullbits.co/nibble/">Nullbits "Nibble" 65%</a> case and
      PCB, black version)
    </li>
    <li><em>Plus the optional Mill-Max 0305 pin receptacles</em></li>
    <li>Kailh Speed Copper switches, filmed and lubed</li>
    <li>
      Full-custom
      <a href="https://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-standard-keysets/"
        >Signature Plastics DSA keycap set</a
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Nibble is an all through-hole PCB which is pretty straightforward to
    assemble. The big line of diodes is left visible at the top and looks great!
    (Just keep them all in line...) I also socketed the controller board for
    safety.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also sourced the ~200 Mill-Max sockets required to make the PCB
    hot-swappable. Not needed, I just liked the idea. The sockets are expensive
    (my gold plated ones are like 15p each! At supply is reliable from Mouser)
    but you can't argue with the convenience of hotswap. They're easy to solder.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kailh switches are their short-throw "speed" variety with a delightful
    3mm of travel (compared to the usual MX default of 4mm). The "copper"
    variants are tactile, my preferred style for environments where I'm not in
    close proximity to anyone else. They're not obnoxiously loud, I just still
    wouldn't use them in an office: I'm not that guy (my office board has Silent
    Reds). I'm super impressed with these switches. Lubed and filmed, they have
    the lowest cap wobble I've ever used and it's <em>such</em> a pleasure to
    start typing every day. I love the short travel. I find it better for
    general use, I didn't buy them for the alleged "optimal gaming performance"
    you usually see quoted as the main draw of so-called "speed" switches. And
    they're very reasonably priced. Highly recommend.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also think the keyset came out beautifully. The DSA profile was an
    experiment for me, but I think it works great on this style of board that
    wants to sit low to the table. I was slightly nervous about getting all of
    the right keys I needed for this moderately unusual form-factor
    <strong>and</strong> moderately unusual layout (ISO). But the options are
    all laid out nicely on the SP pages (linked above) and I was pleased to get
    it all right! They're expensive, but needing ISO really cuts down your
    options when shopping around. I don't begrudge them the price at all though:
    fit and finish is absolutely perfect. Worth every penny.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was also an opportunity to play around with
    <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>. Pretty impressed with it overall, I've
    tried out a lot of different stuff but I'm currently not taking advantage of
    any of the more exotic features. I never found anything super necessary, but
    the flexibility would really come into its own with a super bespoke build or
    funky layout.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall I love the board. I'm just not <em>crazy</em> about the form-factor.
    I don't miss the function row, it's the page-up / page-down buttons being
    directly right of the enter key and the extra macro keys directly to the
    left of shift. I've realised my muscle-memory is set up to go for the keys
    at the edge of the main block for either of these super common actions, so
    when the keys at the edge are now completely different, you screw up a lot!
    It's getting better over time, I just feel like the whole thing would be
    near perfect if they put 5mm in between the main block and the extras*. It'd
    be worth the extra size. It's not like the smallest possible form factor is
    the main design intent here anyway.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    *I think the VA68 style boards are a great example of how this is done - If
    I could find one with a hotswap PCB and without the meh Varmilo firmware I'd
    be all over it! One day...
  </p>

  <p>
    Now I'm very much looking forward to my
    <a href="https://caps-unlocked.com/cu65-gb-r3">CU65</a> arriving! Decided to
    give the 65% another go with the much reduced footprint of a proper PCB
    without any additional fills. Also by the way, definitely
    <strong>don't</strong> get into mechanical keyboards. You will never be
    satisfied.
