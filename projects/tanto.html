    Let me be the first to say that <i>in general</i> this isn't a particularly
    good knife. Either in terms of practicality, design or execution. But
    <i>for me</i>, it's pretty good, and there are a couple of interesting
    points I thought it was worth showing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm referring to it as a "Tanto" simply because it uses the tip shape which
    has taken on that name in modern use. Similarities between this design to
    actual Japanese tanto extend to them both being made out of metal.

    It's actually the first knife I can truly say is completely my own design
    (as you can probably tell...). Usually I copy and modify stuff from other
    people. But I wanted to try and get my head around parametric design, so
    thought I'd pick a little easy 2D project to start off with. So there! The
    goal of this project wasn't actually to build a practical, well-designed or
    well-executed knife all along, it was a learning experience! (he says
    post-rationalising poor decisions...)
  </p>

  <p>
    I did actually enjoy this part of the process. It was very handy to be able
    to rapidly experiment with various shapes and sizes in real-world
    dimensions. Once the parametric design process clicked, it was a lot of fun
    to quickly change things around to keep improving. I can imagine combining
    this with some kind of 3D printing / CNC process to quickly translate the
    designs into something you can hold in your hand for reference would be
    extremely useful. I was constantly holding a ruler while doing this to try
    and get that translation but even doing that, 200mm seemed a lot longer in
    real life.
  </p>

  <p>
    I originally had a fuller kinda thing going along the flat section above the
    bevel, but I realised I can't actually manufacture that. But leaving it
    plain looked stupid, so I added the three bevelled holes just above the
    guard. I think they look cool in person, but it's obviously
    <b>completely impractical</b> to have big weak points right at the already
    weakest point of your tool. If I do another one I'll try and think of
    something less braindead.

    Cutting out the blank was easy with the design printed out (but next time
    remember to put the center marks on all the holes idiot). I even remembered
    to drill the hole that would eventually turn into the sharpening choil!
  </p>

  <p>
    The bevels were cut using my trusty "file attached to a stick" jig. But the
    angles actually ended up matching the plans perfectly and the lines were
    nice and crisp (for me), so everything was apparently good enough! The screw
    sticking up in the middle of the blade is my stop to help me get a nice
    straight plunge, which also came out ok.

    <i>Brass 'n' Fibre</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    I had the brass and carbon-fibre in mind ever since the surprising success
    of the similar design of my
    <a href="/gallery.html?slide=Mule_T15_2">T15 Mule Scales</a> which used
    green G10 as the liners. I also wanted to see if I could do the integrated
    guard kinda thing by brazing a fat bit of brass on top of the liners. This
    turned out to work well enough. I thought it would be smart to put two
    little bits of braze rod physically between the two pieces and then heat
    everything up, thinking that it would just wick together perfectly leaving
    no joint. But I ended up needing to squeeze the two piece together as I
    heated which left a bit of an inconsistent gap which was bigger than I
    ideally wanted. Maybe more even heat or better flux would make this work, or
    maybe just having the pieces flush to start with and then adding braze to
    the outside of the joint to let it wick in would be the way to go.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the carbon-fibre pieces were epoxied on before I finished off the
    profile. This would be much easier with a bandsaw! Took a long time to get
    everything matching.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of the bevels around the scales were done by sticking my tiny belt
    sander at the right angle and freehanding around the carbon-fibre. But all
    the internal corners had to be done by hand. Was a bit of a faff, but I was
    relatively happy.

    In this photo you can see how the scales fit on to the blade with custom
    bolts. I take 5mm wide M4 connectors and Locktite them onto one set of
    screws then cut them to the correct length to form the female bolts which
    register the scales on the blade. Then the male bolts are cut to the right
    length (you want as many threads as possible but don't want to bottom-out in
    the threaded part) and everything goes together nicely. I could only find
    brass countersunk bolts with Phillips heads which look mildly stupid, but
    they fit together well.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is also after everything was hand sanded to 800 grid, acid etched in
    ferric-chloride and then stonewashed with the world's least consistent
    garden rocks.

    I was happy with the finish, but it could probably be better if I used some
    consistent (maybe bigger?) stone media and a nice big tumbler instead of me
    shaking stuff in a bottle like a chimpanzee. I did mask off the carbon fibre
    for this, but it might not have been necessary. It might also look better if
    I left the brass un-etched which would leave it brighter and a better
    contrast to the dark blade.

  <p>
    Finished it up with another Kydex sheath. It's a bit of an awkward shape, so
    I wasn't sure about the designs. Maybe a "taco" style would be better? Also
    it's too tight. My first one was too loose, so the next one is on track to
    be perfect...
  </p>

  <p>
    Blade performance is... fine. Geometry is good! But the edge-retention is
    underwhelming: I've done better with 1095. I think potentially my quench
    tank (paint pot) wasn't quite big enough so my cooling wasn't as quick as it
    usually is with smaller blades. The next one will be better. I should also
    really start experiments with a better steel.
