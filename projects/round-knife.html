    This is a specialised knife for cutting leather, known as a round knife or
    head knife (I think the terms are interchangeable). All the leather for my
    <a href="satchel.html">previous projects</a> had been cut with whatever
    sharp and thin knife I happened to have around at the time, which worked
    fine but never felt very professional. Didn't seem like it would be too hard
    to make, so I had a go.

  <p>
    I started out with finding a good diameter to draw around. Some designs you
    see aren't perfectly round, I don't think it makes much of a difference.
    This was 2.3mm 1084 steel.

    The profile was adjusted by hand until it looked right. I like the slight
    inward sweep of the top sides over the flat topped once you often see. In an
    ideal world it would have a longer tang area for more strength, but I was
    limited by the size of stock I had and didn't want to faff with a more
    complicated construction.

    Bevels were filed by hand. They look convex in this shot, but they flattened
    out when I moved to the diamond stones. Two holes for the pins and some
    little divots to give the epoxy somewhere to hang on to.

    I hardened this one by hand. Using the torch is fine on smaller stuff like
    this. It fit nicely in
    <a href="the-hot-log.html">The Hot Log</a> for tempering. 2 hours at 200°C.
  </p>

  <p>
    Took the bevels to final shape on some chunky diamond stones and then
    sharpened on my natural oilstones. They're about 13° per side. I suspect
    real ones may go thinner than this, but this feels good in my testing. It
    gets extremely sharp and responds well to stropping with some polishing
    compound.

    The handle was a kinda sandwich construction of two pieces of walnut with a
    little notch at the bottom to accept the stubby tang. I was concerned it
    wouldn't feel very strong, but it's fine. In use you're only ever putting
    pressure directly inline with the blade so it's not like it has to withstand
    serious twisting motions like a bushcraft knife or similar would. The
    leather strapping in the background here was cut freehand from a 1500mm long
    belt blank, taking about 5mm off the width. No way I could do that pulling a
    Stanley knife or similar. The pushing motion really helps to keep your piece
    in line.
