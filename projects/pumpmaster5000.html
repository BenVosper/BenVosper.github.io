    My small south-west-facing balcony cycles between scorching hot in the
    spring / summer to inhospitably barren and cold in the winter. There's no
    in-between. I thought I'd create a device to add "occasionally damp" to
    these characteristics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thought I'd keep it simple implementation-wise, so just went with a timer
    approach. In a proper solution, you'd probably do something cool with soil
    moisture / humidity / temperature tracking. But "just dump x liters of water
    per day" works fine for my little pots! I think I ran my perfboard prototype
    outside in a tupperware box for quite a few weeks until it got rained on and
    died. But it had passed proof-of-concept, so I started looking into a more
    permanent solution.

    This was my first custom PCB for a project, but there's not much to it. It's
    just a carrier for an Arduino Mini (which I happened to have in stock) with
    terminals for all the IO. Took a few revisions to fix all of my amateur
    mistakes but <a href="https://easyeda.com/">EasyEDA</a> / JLCPCB makes it
    all quite easy. These days I'd use JST connectors instead of screw
    terminals, I remember these being a particular pain in the ass when
    everything was all in.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code used very dumb low-power mode sleeps to count up a timer and squirt
    for 30 seconds every six hours or something. I've been meaning to figure out
    Arduino interrupts but haven't ever gotten around to it! It was monitoring a
    float-valve in the reservoir as well as an override switch to allow a manual
    top-up if needed. The pump was a small 12V submersible pond pump which had
    plenty of power to fill up the ~3m of tube. It all got crammed into a
    "waterproof" project box with a whole load of silicone. I ran a 240V cable
    from inside under the squishy corner insulation of the balcony door to power
    the whole thing. (One day I'll do a self-contained system with a solar panel
    and a little battery. Would be cool)

    Version 1 used flexible tubing with holes haphazardly poked into it. To
    nobody's great surprise, this was useless. The water all came out around the
    nozzles and the lines sagged and went mouldy in the low spots which filled
    with water. But the setup all survived a year of solid pumping before I
    upgraded to V2 in 2019.

    Version 2 got nice hard tubing and an upgraded enclosure. I could epoxy all
    the nozzles in properly this time so it directed way more water out onto the
    plants rather than trickling it all down the walls. It all looked a lot
    tidier! This time I hung the enclosure from the wall next to the reservoir
    (bin) to keep it out of the rain a bit more: the old enclosure was sitting
    on the floor and was filled with rusty water when I opened it up to turn it
    on again!

  <p>
    I'm still trying to work out how to keep anything at all alive on the desert
    balcony over the winter. I kinda want to try putting a plastic roof over the
    whole thing to make it a little greenhouse...
